Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\r\n\r\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry.

The non-aggressive Workers are easy to take down as they offer little resistance. A Soldier's carapace is armored enough to shurg off regular ammunition rounds, but pulse rifles make short work of them. Soldiers tend to work in groups, overwhelming targets with sheer numbers. Because of this, it is possible to take out a large number of them with an area effect weapon, hopefully evening the odds a bit. Sentries will not leave the inner hive unless the Queen does, so stay out of there and you'll easily avoid them. You know what? Just stay out of an alien hive. Period.\r\n\r\nAcid Splash: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within Engaged Range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\r\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\r\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\r\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\r\n\r\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\r\n\r\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage.

Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xenomorph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire-if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete transformation into an adult-in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass.
