A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108).

If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\r\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\r\n\r\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\r\n\r\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space.

Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\r\n\r\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\r\n\r\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protect it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools.

Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\r\n\r\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\r\n\r\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself.

Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash-hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greather the splash.\r\nThe strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each Success rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammor and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).\r\nThe acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.\r\nIf a victim is Broken by the acid splash or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a Medical Aid roll.\r\n\r\nSprint: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions-i.e., through two zone or from an adjacent zone directly into Engaged range of a target.\r\n\r\nResistance to Vacuum: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.\r\n\r\nFalling: The Xeenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.\r\n\r\nImmune to the Cold: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.\r\n\r\nRadiation: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects-i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).\r\n\r\nNo Respiration: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.\r\n\r\nNo Heat Signature: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.\r\n","label":"Text"},"acidSplash":{"value":"10","label":"Acid Splash"}},"notes":"<p>Stage VI P. praepotens are monstrous horrors.

Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist. Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the latter P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injuected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens.\r\n\r\nFacehugging: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within Engaged range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.\r\n\r\nContainment and Termination Protocol: A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host's face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protect it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools.
