The PC token needs to be selected.&nbsp; When a roll is pushed the PC's Stress level will automatically be increased by 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Right clicking on any Attributes, Skills or Equipment will display a dialogue box allowing dice to be added or subtracted from the roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Character &amp; Synth sheets</h1>\n<p>If the players are running a Synth and the rest of the party are aware that the PC is a Synth use the Synth sheet.&nbsp; If the other players are unaware use the normal character sheet and disregard Stress, Radiation, Conditions and Consumables. Though you may want the player to \"roll\" against these to maintain the pretext that they are human.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NPC's</h2>\n<p>As the character sheets are the same for Characters and NPC's there are not seperate templates for these.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the Character and Synth sheets there is an NPC check box (only visible to the GM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this is checked, when the actor is dragged on to the Scene the Token will be set to <em>Unlinked</em> and <em>Hostile</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Unchecking the NPC box will not affect existing tokens.</strong></p>\n<h1>General Tab</h1>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">Roll against attributes by clicking on the attribute name, not the number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">For Stress tests click on Stress to roll (publicly) against the stress table.&nbsp; &nbsp;The result will appear in chat and any modifiers need to be applied manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Experience, Radiation and Conditions.</h2>\n<p>Left click to set increment the counter and right click to decrement.

The table will then appears as a selectable option in the Attack Table drop down.&nbsp; To roll against the table hit the \"Roll Attack\" button.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Vehicle Sheets</h1>\n<p>Heavy weapons (Items) can be dragged on the Inventory and behave the same as weapons on the character sheets.&nbsp; But they do not take into account any modifiers from the PC firing the weapon so use right mouse click to add any modifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Territory sheets</h1>\n<p>General tab provides two text boxes to give a general description and specific data about the sectors.&nbsp; &nbsp;The systems tab allows individual systems (created as Items) to be dragged on to the sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Items</h1>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">Specific sheets are available for Armor, Systems/Planets, Talents and Weapons.&nbsp; For general items use \"Item\" and the drop down to select the type.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill-Stunts</h2>\n<p>The system will create&nbsp; a folder in Items called Skill-Stunts and automatically populate with each of the skills.&nbsp; Just open the skill and using the editor add the required text from the rules and format as required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Macros</h1>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">The Alien Compendium has 2 macros to allow ad-hoc rolls against Mother and Creature tables.&nbsp; The tables need to be in the correct folder for the macros to display them in the drop down.&nbsp; &nbsp;These are private GM rolls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">There are also 2 macros for ad hoc dice rolls.&nbsp; The GM macro is a private GM roll.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\"><strong>Multiple Initiative Rolls for&nbsp;<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-family: Signika, sans-serif;\">XENOMORPHS.</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-family: Signika, sans-serif;\">Some creatures have multiple attacks based on their speed.&nbsp; Unfortunatly (currently) in Foundry VTT there is not way to emulate this mechanic but shteff#8724 on Discord has developed the following:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Signika; font-size: 10.5pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;\"><strong>IMPORTANT: you must have \"The Furnace\" module with the 'Advanced Macros' option ON. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;\">So, once you have added your aliens to the combat tracker, just select token you want to add again and click on the macro.
