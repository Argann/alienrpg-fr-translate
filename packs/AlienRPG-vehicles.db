The Daihotai's eight wheeel suspension offers a relatively smooth ride over all but the most serious of bumps. These modular tractors can be fitted with bulldozer blades, diggers, cutters, cranes, core samplers, spring stampers, welders, bore drills, combines, and more. Some colonists have even mounted weapons on these tractors and used them to protect their hard work. Trailers can be hitched to the Daihotai and it can be used as a cross country cargo hauler (the farmers and ranchers on Terraform 3 use the tractors to ferry crops and steer to and from the spaceport). The tractor's cabin is enclosed and pressurized with its own self-contained environment. A Daihotai can function in a poisonous atmosphere or even on an airless moon. Top Speed: 148 km/h.

While true gunships like the Tomahawk are more heavily armed and strikeships like the Cougar and Bearcat are more maneuverable, none have the versatility of the Cheyenne. The Cheyenne are dropped from orbit into the fray from the ventral bay of any USCMC frigate or carrier, swiftly descending through the atmosphere like a meteor. The current model has been specifically augmented to carry the M577 into a combat zone, deploy the APC and its marine squad, and immediately assume an air support role for the squad. The ship is mostly transport bay with cockpit, weapons systems, and engines attached-there is little in the way of other accomodations aboard. While in supersonic decent, the Cheyenne's weapons pods are retracted flush with its hull. These pods deploy for subsonic combat. With a proper satellite uplink, the Cheyenne is capable of being flown by remote from a portable terminal. Few pilots have the skill necessary for this maneuver, and the task is usually left to the squad's android XO. Length: 25.2m.

Its interior is equipped with a tactical command center with links to each soldier's helmet cams and biosigns. The exterior is armored with a laser absorbent paint job. In addition to chaff launchers and a small front mounted turret, the M570 mounts a rotating main weapons package on a rail system that allows it to slide back and store in the rear of the vehicle when not in use, thus lowering the APC's profile and heat signature. The air pressure in its large, armored wheels is controlled by the driver in order to facilitate better traction over soft terrain and allow the vehicle's chassis some additional clearance over rough ground-its low profile is perhaps the APC's biggest weakness. Put a reckless driver behind the wheel in a rocky environment and you are likely to blow the transaxle. The amphibious and vacuum tight APC is designed to be carried in the vehicle bay of a Cheyenne dropship, allowing it to be deployed nearly anywhere.
